‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Logic and Flow)
Startup

run_supply_chain_app() creates the main window and initializes the app.

SupplyChainApp class sets up inventory, suppliers, orders, and GUI widgets.

Inventory System

Inventory class manages a dictionary of products and quantities.

Provides add_stock(), reduce_stock(), and get_stock() methods.

Placing Orders

User selects a product and enters quantity.

On submit:

The app checks if stock is enough.

Reduces stock if available.

Adds the order to history with time, product, quantity, and status.

Restocking Inventory

User selects a product and quantity to add.

Updates the inventory.

Managing Suppliers

User inputs a supplier name and the product they supply.

Adds this information to a list and displays it.

Order Export

User clicks ‚ÄúExport Orders to CSV‚Äù.

Opens file save dialog.

Writes all order data to a .csv file.
